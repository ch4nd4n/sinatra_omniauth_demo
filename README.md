### Introduction
Sample code to use Omniauth in conjunction with Sinatra.

### Derived from

I watched [this Railcast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/304-omniauth-identity?view=asciicast) to get an idea of how Omniauth can be used in Ruby.

Take  a look at the code to understand rest of it.

### Few things added

* Use of Twitter Bootstrap
* Customized log in and registration page
* Use of Identity Strategy
